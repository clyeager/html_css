1. semantic tags: <article>, <aside>, <section>, <b>, <strong>, <header>, <footer>, <h3>
not semantic: <div>, <span>

2. <article>

3. This HTML could be a <blockquote> as it is an extended quotation.

4. This should use a <section> tag, as it is part of the flow of the site and also logical to have a title.

5. This would be appropriate as an <aside>, because it's still relevant but not part of the main text.
